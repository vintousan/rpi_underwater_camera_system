Abstract:
Computer vision and image processing technologies are applied towards aquatic research to understand fish and its interaction to other fishes and its environment. The understanding from vision-based data acquisition and processing aids in the development of predictive frameworks and decision support systems for efficient aquaculture monitoring and management. However, this emerging field is confronted by lack of high quality underwater visual data, whether from public or local setups. Accessible underwater camera systems that obtain underwater visual data periodically and in real-time is the most desired system for such emerging studies. In this regard, an underwater camera system that captures underwater images from inland freshwater aquaculture setup is proposed. The underwater camera system devices are mostly based on Raspberry Pi, an open-source computing platform. The underwater camera continuously provides a real-time video streaming link of underwater scenes. The local processor periodically acquires data from this link, in form of images. These data are stored locally and remotely. Also, the local processor initiates a connection to a remote processor to allow the remote view of the real-time video streaming link. Aside from accessing the data and streaming link remotely, the remote processor analyzes the statistics of the underwater images to motivate the application of color balance and fusion, a state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement method. The application of the enhancement is objectively evaluated, in terms of information content and edge details. The proposed system can capture around 1.2 Gb worth of 8 MP underwater images during daytime every day at a rate of 6.244 - 6.528 fps and can store these images to a cloud storage at 0 â€“ 5.55%. Also, the system captures subjects within 10-35 cm at turbid fishpond water. The statistical analysis of the gathered data reveals that underwater images from turbid fishpond setups have low quality, in terms of inaccurate color representations (i.e., dominant green intensities, and mostly submissive blue intensities) and low contrast. These observations appropriate the application of color balance and fusion to the locally acquired data. Furthermore, the objective evaluation reveals that the color balance and fusion is the most effective method of improving information content and edge details, as quantified by high color information entropies and high average gradients.
